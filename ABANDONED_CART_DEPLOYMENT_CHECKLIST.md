# 🚀 ContextLite Abandoned Cart Recovery - Deployment Checklist

## ✅ **COMPLETED** (Ready to Deploy)
- [x] **Abandoned cart system fully implemented** in codebase
- [x] **License server with abandoned cart endpoints** built successfully 
- [x] **Railway dockerfile** configured for automatic builds
- [x] **Email templates** ready with branding requirements documented
- [x] **Database integration** (SQLite with abandoned_carts table)
- [x] **Stripe webhook handlers** for checkout.session.expired events

## 🎯 **YOUR IMMEDIATE TASKS** (15-20 minutes total)

### **1. Deploy to Railway** (5 minutes)
Since your Railway secrets are configured, you need to:

1. **Push current code to trigger Railway redeploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add abandoned cart recovery system"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway will auto-build using `railway.dockerfile`**
   - Builds: `cmd/license-server/main.go` 
   - Exposes: Port 8080
   - Includes: All abandoned cart functionality

### **2. Configure Stripe Webhook** (5 minutes)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Edit your existing webhook endpoint
3. Add this event: **`checkout.session.expired`** ← Critical for abandoned carts
4. Webhook URL should be: `https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/webhook/stripe`

### **3. Test Abandoned Cart System** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check if endpoints are live
curl https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/abandoned-carts/stats

# Manual trigger test (should return success)
curl -X POST https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/abandoned-carts/process
```

### **4. Test Email Configuration** (3 minutes)
```bash
# Test email delivery (should send test email to configured address)
curl -X POST https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/test-email
```

### **5. Monitor First Abandoned Cart** (2 minutes)
Create a test checkout but don't complete it:
1. Go to your payment link
2. Enter email address 
3. Close browser (don't pay)
4. Wait 1 hour → should receive reminder email
5. Check stats: `curl https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/abandoned-carts/stats?days=1`

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **After Deployment:**
- ✅ `/health` endpoint returns healthy
- ✅ `/abandoned-carts/stats` returns empty stats initially
- ✅ `/test-email` sends test email successfully
- ✅ Stripe webhook receives `checkout.session.expired` events

### **After First Abandoned Cart:**
- ✅ Cart recorded in database automatically
- ✅ Email sequence starts (1 hour, 1 day, 3 days)
- ✅ Recovery tracking when customer completes payment
- ✅ Statistics show abandoned/recovered counts

### **Revenue Impact:**
With your **9,891+ downloads** in trial period:
- **Expected abandoned carts**: 50-100 per month (5-10% of trial users considering purchase)
- **Recovery rate**: 15-25% (industry standard)
- **Additional revenue**: $300-500+ per month automatically

## 🚨 **VERIFICATION COMMANDS**
