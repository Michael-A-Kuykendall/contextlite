description: |
  Address the remaining test failures and gaps identified in the comprehensive test run.
  Target the failing packages and increase overall test coverage to 95%+.
  
  Current Status: 82% success rate (9/11 packages passing). Focus on internal/storage 
  package issues and integration suite server connectivity problems.

objectives:
  - Fix failing internal/storage package tests
  - Resolve integration suite server connectivity issues  
  - Address storage timeout and database constraint handling
  - Increase test coverage to 95%+
  - Achieve 100% package success rate (11/11 packages)
  
context:
  repository: "Michael-A-Kuykendall/contextlite"
  current_success_rate: "82% (9/11 packages passing)"
  main_issues: "storage serialization, integration port config"
  target_coverage: "95%+ test coverage"
  
inputs:
  - failing_packages: "internal/storage, test/integration_suite"
  - test_configuration: "port 8082 vs 8084 mismatch"
  - storage_errors: "cache serialization, timeout issues"

tasks:
  1:

    action: "Update hardcoded port references from 8082 to 8084"
    expected_output: "Integration tests connecting to correct server"
    
  3:
    name: "Increase Test Coverage for Uncovered Paths"
    action: "Add tests for missing edge cases and error paths"
    expected_output: "95%+ test coverage achieved across all packages"
    
  4:
    name: "Performance Optimization and Benchmarks"
    action: "Optimize test execution and add performance benchmarks"
    expected_output: "Tests complete reliably within reasonable time"

validation_criteria:
  - All 11 packages pass tests (100% success rate)
  - 95%+ code coverage achieved across all packages
  - No test timeouts or flaky tests
  - Integration suite connects properly to server
  - Storage serialization works correctly

success_metrics:
  - package_success: "100% (11/11 packages passing)"
  - coverage: "95%+ overall test coverage"
  - performance: "Test suite completes in <2 minutes"
  - reliability: "Tests pass consistently across runs"
  
deliverables:
  - Fixed test suite with all packages passing
  - Updated test configuration files
  - Comprehensive coverage reports
  - Performance benchmarks

risk_assessment: "LOW"
risk_notes: |
  - Test fixes are isolated to test code
  - Configuration changes only affect test environment
  
model_rationale: |
  Using llama32-champion:latest because:
  - Go testing expertise required
  - Database testing knowledge needed
  - Integration testing coordination
