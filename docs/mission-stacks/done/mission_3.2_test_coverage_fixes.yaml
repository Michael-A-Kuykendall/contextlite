description: |
  Address the remaining test failures and gaps identified in the comprehensive test run.
  Target the failing packages and increase overall test coverage to 95%+.
  
  Current Status: 82% success rate (9/11 packages passing). Focus on internal/storage 
  package issues and integration suite server connectivity problems.

objectives:
  - "Fix failing internal/storage package tests"
  - "Resolve integration suite server connectivity issues"  
  - "Address storage timeout and database constraint handling"
  - "Increase test coverage to 95%+"
  - "Achieve 100% package success rate (11/11 packages)"
