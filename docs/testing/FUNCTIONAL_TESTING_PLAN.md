# 🧪 FUNCTIONAL TESTING PLAN
## End-to-End Validation of All Deployment Channels

**Created**: August 20, 2025, 01:30 AM  
**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL - NOT TESTED IN PRODUCTION**  
**Reality Check**: We went live without testing any deployment channel functionally

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**We deployed to production without functional testing ANY channel:**
- ✅ GitHub Releases: Published ✅ 
- ✅ npm: Published ✅
- ✅ PyPI: Published ✅  
- ✅ Docker Hub: Published ✅
- ✅ Hugging Face: Published ✅

**But have we actually USED any of them? NO.**

This is exactly how users find bugs before we do. Let's fix this RIGHT NOW.

## 🎯 TESTING METHODOLOGY

### Core Test Scenario
**Same corpus, same operations across ALL channels:**

1. **Install** the package via each method
2. **Ingest** a test corpus (same for all tests)
3. **Query** the corpus with known test queries
4. **Verify** responses are correct and performant
5. **Test** edge cases (large files, special characters, etc.)
6. **Document** any issues or inconsistencies

### Test Corpus
**Use consistent test data:**
- 10 small text files (1-5KB each)
- 3 medium files (50-100KB each) 
- 1 large file (1MB+)
- Files with special characters, code, markdown
- Known queries with expected results
