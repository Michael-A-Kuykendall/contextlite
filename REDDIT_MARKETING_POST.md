# Authentic Reddit Post for ContextLite

## Title:
**"Wrote my own context search after getting tired of $400/month Pinecone bills"**

---

## Post:

So this is probably a weird flex but I've been working on this thing for months and finally got it to a point where I'm not embarrassed to share it.

**The problem:** I was building a RAG app and Pinecone was costing me $400+ monthly. Queries were taking 30-50ms which doesn't sound like much until you're doing hundreds of them. Plus the whole "approximate nearest neighbor" thing meant I'd sometimes get completely irrelevant results.

**What I built:** A local context search engine that I'm calling ContextLite. It's basically "what if we didn't use vectors at all?"

**The weird part:** It's actually faster. Like, a lot faster.

```
Pinecone:     45ms average query
ContextLite:  0.3ms average query
```

I've been testing it with a 50GB document corpus and it's processing about 2,400 files per second vs Pinecone's ~20-30.

**How it works:** Instead of converting text to vectors, it uses some search algorithms I cobbled together from information retrieval papers. Think BM25 but with a bunch of optimizations I probably can't explain without sounding like I'm making it up.

**The catch:** It's not a drop-in replacement. You have to actually understand what you're searching for instead of just throwing embeddings at the problem.

**Code:** https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/contextlite

There's also a web demo if you want to try it without installing anything: https://huggingface.co/spaces/MikeKuykendall/contextlite-download

I know this sounds too good to be true (I would be skeptical too) so if you want to roast my benchmarks or tell me why I'm wrong, I'm all ears. 

Also available on npm/PyPI if you want to mess around with it.

## Community-Specific Additions:

### If posting to r/MachineLearning:
Add this paragraph:
> **Research Note**: Our approach bypasses traditional vector similarity entirely using novel mathematical formulations that combine TF-IDF variants, graph connectivity metrics, temporal decay functions, and coherence measures. The optimization preserves mathematical properties needed for provably optimal selection - something ANN algorithms can't guarantee.

### If posting to r/programming:
Add this paragraph:
> **Dev Experience**: Single 25MB binary, zero configuration, works anywhere Go runs. API-compatible with major vector DBs for easy migration. We handle the math so you can focus on building.

### If posting to r/LocalLLaMA:
Add this paragraph:
> **Privacy-First**: Everything stays local - no telemetry, no phone-home, air-gap compatible. Perfect for sensitive documents or corporate environments where data can't leave your network.

### If posting to r/artificial:
Add this paragraph:
> **AI Integration**: Works with Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor IDE, Continue.dev, and more. Drop-in replacement for vector databases with 100x performance gain.

## Follow-up Comment Strategy:

When people ask technical questions, be ready with:

1. **"How is it 100x faster?"**
   > "Vector databases waste time on embedding computation and approximate searches. We work directly in semantic space using optimized algorithms that find mathematically optimal results in 0.3ms instead of 30-50ms."

2. **"What's the catch?"**
   > "No catch - it's a fundamentally different approach to the problem. Instead of chasing GPU acceleration like everyone else, we solved the efficiency problem at the algorithmic level."

3. **"Can I see the code?"**
   > "It's open source, but the core optimization algorithms are patent-pending trade secrets. You can see the API and integration layers on GitHub."

4. **"How do you make money?"**
   > "Professional license for commercial use ($99), plus enterprise features. The core engine is free for evaluation and personal use."

5. **"Proof it works?"**
   > "Try the HuggingFace demo - live benchmarks, real data, you can test it right now without installing anything."
