## The Math

**If 1% of people produce:**
- 100 signups = 1 producer
- 1,000 signups = 10 producers
- 10 producers × 2 deals/month = 20 deals
- 20 deals × $5,000 average = $100,000 revenue
- Less 33% commission = $67,000 profit

**Your time invested: 2 hours setup + 1 hour/week maintenance**

---

## Final Word

Stop thinking like a manager. Think like a platform.

You're not recruiting salespeople. You're opening a hunting ground.

Some will hunt. Most won't. You only pay the ones who bring meat.

The rest? They're just usernames in a database that cost you nothing.

**Let everyone in. Pay the ones who perform. Ignore the rest.**

That's the entire strategy.
