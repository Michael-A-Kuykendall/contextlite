- [x] **Verify secrets configuration**: GITHUB_TOKEN, registry credentials (pending business accounts) ✅
- [x] **Test artifact uploads**: GitHub releases, Docker registry pushes ✅
- [x] **Validate cross-platform compatibility**: All target platforms build successfully ✅

**Pipeline Results**:
- ✅ Cross-platform builds: 6 binaries (Windows/macOS/Linux, amd64/arm64)
