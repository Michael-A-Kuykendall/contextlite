# 🚂 Railway Deployment - Your Existing Setup

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS**
- ✅ Railway application running: `contextlite-production.up.railway.app`
- ✅ SMTP configuration already set up
- ✅ Basic license server working
- ❌ Abandoned cart system NOT YET deployed (still on old version)

## 🚀 **DEPLOY ABANDONED CART SYSTEM** (2 minutes)

### **Option 1: Railway Dashboard Redeploy**
1. **Go to Railway Dashboard** → Your contextlite project
2. **Go to Deployments tab**
3. **Click "Deploy Latest"** or **"Redeploy"**
4. **Railway will pull latest code** (includes abandoned cart system)
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for build to complete

### **Option 2: Force GitHub Sync** (if connected)
1. **In Railway Dashboard** → Settings
2. **Check if GitHub repo connected**
3. **If connected**: Railway should auto-deploy from our recent push
4. **If not connected**: Use Option 1

### **Option 3: Manual Trigger** (since you have Railway CLI)
```bash
# Connect to your existing project
railway login
railway link [your-project-id]

# Deploy latest code
railway up
```

## 📧 **YOUR SMTP IS READY**
Since you already have SMTP configured, once the abandoned cart system deploys:

### **Test Email System:**
```bash
# This should work with your existing SMTP
curl -X POST https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-email@gmail.com"}'
```

### **Test Abandoned Cart System:**
```bash
# These will work after redeploy
curl https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/abandoned-carts/stats
curl -X POST https://contextlite-production.up.railway.app/abandoned-carts/process
```

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE**
- ✅ Railway project configured
- ✅ Environment variables set (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, etc.)
- ✅ Custom domain or Railway URL working
- ✅ HTTPS automatically configured

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU NEED**
- [ ] **Deploy latest code** (contains abandoned cart system)
- [ ] **Add Stripe webhook event**: `checkout.session.expired`
- [ ] **Test the new endpoints**

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION**
**Go to Railway Dashboard → Deployments → Click "Deploy Latest"**

The abandoned cart system will be live in 2-3 minutes! 🎉
