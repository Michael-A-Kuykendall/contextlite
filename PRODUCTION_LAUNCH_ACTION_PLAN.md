# ðŸš€ ContextLite Production Launch Action Plan

**Date Created:** August 19, 2025  
**Status:** ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE â†’ EXECUTION READY  
**Priority:** CRITICAL PATH TO PRODUCTION LAUNCH  

---

## **ðŸ“‹ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Based on comprehensive production readiness audits, ContextLite has **5 critical issues** and **comprehensive integration testing** required before commercial launch. This plan provides granular, executable steps to achieve production readiness.

**Current Status:** 95% production ready with focused work needed on:
1. Rate limiting implementation
2. Vulnerability scanning automation  
3. Stripe integration testing
4. Installation/uninstallation documentation
5. **End-to-end integration verification** (all platforms/scenarios)

---

## **ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1: CRITICAL SECURITY & INFRASTRUCTURE (Priority 1)**

### **Task 1.1: Implement Rate Limiting Middleware**
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Criticality:** LAUNCH BLOCKER  

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create rate limiter middleware** (`internal/api/middleware/rate_limiter.go`)
   - Token bucket algorithm (recommended: `golang.org/x/time/rate`)
   - Configurable rates per endpoint class
   - Redis backend option for multi-instance deployments
   - Graceful degradation when rate limit hit

2. **Add configuration support** (`pkg/config/config.go`)
   ```yaml
   server:
     rate_limiting:
       enabled: true
       requests_per_minute: 60
       burst: 10
       endpoint_specific:
         "/api/v1/query": 30
         "/api/v1/enterprise/*": 100
   ```

3. **Integration points:**
   - Add to server middleware chain in `internal/api/server.go`
   - Skip rate limiting for health check endpoints
   - Add rate limit headers to responses (`X-RateLimit-*`)

4. **Testing requirements:**
   - Unit tests for rate limiter logic
   - Integration tests with actual HTTP requests
   - Load testing to verify limits work under pressure

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Rate limiting middleware implemented and configurable
- [x] Integration tests pass with rate limiting enabled
- [x] No performance degradation for normal usage
- [x] Proper HTTP 429 responses when limits exceeded
- [x] Rate limit headers included in all responses

   ```yaml
   - name: Run govulncheck
     run: |
       go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
       govulncheck ./...
   
   - name: Run nancy (alternative)
     run: |
       go list -json -m all | nancy sleuth
   ```

2. **Add to existing workflows:**
   - Integrate into `.github/workflows/test.yml`
   - Add to PR checks and release pipeline
   - Configure failure thresholds

3. **Local development integration:**
   - Add `make security-scan` target to Makefile
   - Include in pre-commit hooks (optional)
   - Document in development workflow

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `govulncheck` integrated into CI pipeline
