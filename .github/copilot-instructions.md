## 2. FINAL LAUNCH EXECUTION PLAN (August 19, 2025)

### **Production Launch Action Plan âœ…**
- **File**: `PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Complete execution roadmap
- **Status**: 5 critical tasks identified for production launch
- **Phases**: Security, Integration Testing, Stripe Testing, Documentation, Automation
- **Timeline**: 1-3 weeks to production launch depending on integration testing results

### **Critical Tasks Remaining**
1. **Rate Limiting Implementation**: Token bucket middleware for API protection
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: `govulncheck` integration into CI pipeline
3. **Comprehensive Integration Testing**: All platforms, package managers, scenarios
4. **Stripe Payment Flow Testing**: End-to-end payment processing validation
5. **Installation/Uninstallation Documentation**: Complete user experience polish

### **Integration Testing Matrix**
- **Platforms**: Windows 11, macOS 14+, Ubuntu 22.04 (x64 + ARM64)
- **Distribution**: Direct binary, npm, PyPI, VS Code extension
- **Scenarios**: Fresh install, trial flow, license activation, performance testing
- **Cross-Platform**: User has Mac available for macOS testing

## 3. Key Workflows

### **Development Workflow**
- Build: `make build` (produces `./build/contextlite`)
- Test: `make test` (all tests pass)
- Local trial: Run `./build/contextlite` (starts 14-day trial automatically)

### **Release Workflow**
- Tag release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`
- Automatic: GitHub Actions builds all platforms
- Distribution: Multi-platform archives with trial system
- Private Binary: Auto-synced from private repository

### **Trial Experience**
- **First Run**: Automatically starts 14-day trial with full SMT features
- **Day 1-11**: Full access with daily reminders
- **Day 12-14**: Warning messages about approaching expiration
- **Day 15+**: Core engine only, purchase prompts

## 4. Architecture Patterns

### **Feature Gate Pattern**
```go
// Enhanced feature gate with trial support
featureGate := license.NewEnhancedFeatureGate()
status := featureGate.GetStatus()
remaining := featureGate.TrialDaysRemaining()
```

### **Repository Marriage Pattern**
```yaml
# Private repo pushes trigger public repo binary update
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [private-binary-updated]
```

### **Trial Management Pattern**
```go
// Hardware-bound trial with graceful degradation
trialManager := NewTrialManager()
isActive := trialManager.IsTrialActive()
remaining := trialManager.DaysRemaining()
```

## 5. Production Readiness Status âœ…

### **Audit Results** (from `PRODUCTION_AUDIT_REBUTTAL.md`)
- **License Server**: âœ… Fully implemented and production-ready
- **Engine Architecture**: âœ… Sophisticated dual-engine with robust fallback
