# ContextLite AI Coding Agent Instructions

Purpose: Enable an AI agent to be productive immediately in this repo. Follow these repo-specific conventions. Keep changes minimal, fast, and aligned with the existing architecture.

## üéØ COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
**MANDATORY**: Always use professional language when communicating with the user. Maintain a respectful, technical, and business-appropriate tone in all interactions.

## üìÅ INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION POLICY 
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: All internal planning documents MUST be created in `internal-docs/` folder to protect IP

### **Internal Document Classification**
- **`internal-docs/planning/`** - Task lists, integration plans, project roadmaps
- **`internal-docs/security/`** - Security audits, compliance reports, vulnerability assessments
- **`internal-docs/deployment-audits/`** - Deployment failures, workflow analysis, chaos audits
- **`internal-docs/business-strategy/`** - Marketing plans, enterprise strategies, competitive analysis
- **`internal-docs/mission-stacks/`** - Mission execution plans, AI automation strategies

### **Content Guidelines**
1. **Confidential ‚Üí `internal-docs/`**: Business strategies, security audits, internal processes, competitive intelligence
2. **Public ‚Üí `docs/`**: User guides, API documentation, installation instructions, contribution guidelines
3. **IP Protection**: Never expose proprietary methods, internal architecture details, or sensitive business information in public docs
4. **Git Ignore**: `internal-docs/` automatically excluded from repository to prevent accidental exposure

### **Document Creation Rules**
- Planning documents, task master lists, strategy papers ‚Üí Always `internal-docs/`
- User-facing documentation, tutorials, API guides ‚Üí Always `docs/`
- When in doubt about classification ‚Üí Default to `internal-docs/` for safety

### **Deployment Audit Results ‚úÖ**
- **File**: `DEPLOYMENT_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md` - Complete workflow analysis
- **Status**: Comprehensive audit of v1.0.35 deployment completed
- **Success Rate**: 4/12 package managers working (33% success rate)
- **Root Cause Identified**: Core build-and-release job compilation failure

### **Working Package Managers** ‚úÖ
1. **npm**: Perfect conditional deployment with existence checking
2. **PyPI**: Perfect conditional deployment with package reuse
3. **GitHub Packages**: Reliable scoped package distribution
4. **Chocolatey**: Conditional logic working (correctly skipped existing package)

### **Failing Package Managers** ‚ùå
- **build-and-release**: Go compilation error (blocks all binary-dependent packages)
- **Docker Hub**: Depends on working binaries from build-and-release
- **Homebrew**: Checksum calculation fails (needs GitHub release assets)
- **AUR (Arch)**: Publishing failure (SSH/permission issue)
- **Crates (Rust)**: Publishing failure (token/permission issue)
- **Snap**: Build failure (snapcraft configuration issue)

### **Not Implemented** ‚ö´
- **WinGet, Flathub, Nix, Scoop**: Completely skipped (need implementation)

### **Critical Tasks Remaining**
1. **Fix Go compilation error in build-and-release** (30 min) ‚Üí immediately fixes 5+ packages
2. **Debug token/permission issues** (1 hour) ‚Üí fixes AUR, Crates publishing
3. **Add conditional checks to remaining jobs** (2 hours) ‚Üí prevents duplicate errors
4. **Implement 4 missing package managers** (4 hours) ‚Üí completes ecosystem

## 3. Key Workflows

### **Development Workflow**
- Build: `make build` (produces `./build/contextlite`)
- Test: `make test` (all tests pass)
- Local trial: Run `./build/contextlite` (starts 14-day trial automatically)

### **Release Workflow**
- Tag release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`
- Automatic: GitHub Actions builds all platforms
- Distribution: Multi-platform archives with trial system
- Private Binary: Auto-synced from private repository

### **Trial Experience**
- **First Run**: Automatically starts 14-day trial with full SMT features
- **Day 1-11**: Full access with daily reminders
- **Day 12-14**: Warning messages about approaching expiration
- **Day 15+**: Core engine only, purchase prompts

## 4. Architecture Patterns

### **Feature Gate Pattern**
```go
// Enhanced feature gate with trial support
featureGate := license.NewEnhancedFeatureGate()
status := featureGate.GetStatus()
remaining := featureGate.TrialDaysRemaining()
```

### **Repository Marriage Pattern**
```yaml
# Private repo pushes trigger public repo binary update
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [private-binary-updated]
```

### **Trial Management Pattern**
```go
// Hardware-bound trial with graceful degradation
trialManager := NewTrialManager()
isActive := trialManager.IsTrialActive()
remaining := trialManager.DaysRemaining()
```

## 7. GitHub Token Usage & API Patterns

### **GitHub Token Access Pattern**
```bash
# Environment variable (already set in user's shell)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# API calls use this pattern
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" "https://api.github.com/repos/Michael-A-Kuykendall/contextlite/actions/runs"

# Common endpoints:
# - /actions/runs (list workflow runs)
# - /actions/runs/ID/jobs (get job details)  
# - /releases (get release info)
```

### **Deployment Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Check latest workflow status
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/Michael-A-Kuykendall/contextlite/actions/runs?per_page=5"

# Get detailed job breakdown
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/Michael-A-Kuykendall/contextlite/actions/runs/ID/jobs"

# Check release assets  
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/Michael-A-Kuykendall/contextlite/releases"
```

- **Spokes**: All other package managers consume these artifacts
- **Failure Mode**: Hub failure cascades to all binary-dependent spokes
- **Current Issue**: Hub compilation failure blocking 5+ package managers

### **Best Practices Identified**
From successful npm/PyPI implementations:
- Dynamic package structure generation
- API-based existence checking  
- Version synchronization from single source
- Graceful skipping with clear logging

### **Immediate Fix Strategy**
1. **Debug Go compilation error** (30 min) ‚Üí fixes 5+ packages immediately
2. **Add missing conditional checks** (2 hours) ‚Üí prevents duplicate errors
3. **Debug token/permission issues** (1 hour) ‚Üí fixes publishing failures
4. **Implement missing packages** (4 hours) ‚Üí completes ecosystem

## 12. Mission Architecture & AI Integration üéØ

### **Shimmy as Primary Interface (Future Intention)**
- **Architecture Decision**: Shimmy will be the primary interaction point with Rustchain
- **Integration Flow**: Mission YAML ‚Üí Rustchain ‚Üí Shimmy ‚Üí Champion Model ‚Üí Results
- **Fallback Strategy**: Direct Ollama/HTTP APIs for specific edge cases
- **Champion Model**: `llama32-champion:latest` (custom-trained on Rust/Go projects)

### **Mission Workflow System**
```
docs/mission-stacks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ current/     # Active missions being executed
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ done/        # Completed missions with results
```

### **Mission Lifecycle Management**
1. Critical tasks ‚Üí Mission chunks ‚Üí YAML generation
2. **MANDATORY**: Validate mission with `./rustchain.exe mission validate [mission.yaml]`
3. **MANDATORY**: Dry-run validation with `./rustchain.exe run --dry-run [mission.yaml]`
4. Place in `current/` ‚Üí Rustchain execution ‚Üí Champion AI processing
5. **MANDATORY**: Validate results and fix template variables before archival
6. Validation ‚Üí Results archival ‚Üí Move to `done/`
7. Expected processing time: 20-30 minutes for full critical task list

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE**: Always run validate ‚Üí dry-run first to catch issues early and save time!

## 13. Complete Release Mission Workflow üöÄ

### **Mission Organization Structure**
```
docs/mission-stacks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ current/        # Active missions being executed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hopper/         # Ready missions queued for execution  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ done/           # Completed missions with results
```

### **Mission Execution Protocol**
1. **Validate**: `./rustchain.exe mission validate [mission.yaml]`
2. **Dry-run**: `./rustchain.exe run --dry-run [mission.yaml]`
3. **Execute**: `./rustchain.exe run [mission.yaml]`
4. **Validate Results**: Check output quality and completeness
5. **Fix & Retry**: If mission fails, correct once and retry; if fails twice, finish manually and move on
6. **Archive**: Move completed missions to `done/` folder with timestamp

### **Mission Failure Protocol**
- **First Failure**: Debug, fix mission, retry once
- **Second Failure**: Complete task manually, document issue, move to next mission
- **Quality Control**: All results must be validated before archival
- **Persistence**: All work must be documented and preserved

### **Release Process Integration**
- Code fixes ‚Üí Documentation updates ‚Üí Marketing materials ‚Üí Deployment preparation
- All steps must be mission-driven with Champion AI execution
- Maintain consistency across all release artifacts
- Ensure complete traceability from code to marketing

## 14. Railway CLI Master Guide üéØ

### **CRITICAL: Interactive vs Non-Interactive Commands**
**ROOT PROBLEM**: Railway CLI defaults to interactive prompts that LOCK UP scripts

### **‚úÖ CORRECT: Non-Interactive Usage**
```bash
# ALWAYS specify service/environment explicitly
railway service contextlite-testing
railway logs -s contextlite-testing  
railway up -s contextlite-testing
railway variables -s contextlite-testing
railway ssh -s contextlite-testing -- ls
```

### **‚ùå WRONG: Interactive Commands (WILL LOCK UP)**
```bash
# NEVER USE - these open interactive selectors
railway service      # Opens selector menu - LOCKS UP
railway ssh          # Waits for service selection - LOCKS UP
railway environment  # Opens environment selector - LOCKS UP
```

### **Authentication with Project Tokens**
```bash
export RAILWAY_TOKEN="d66cb512-df83-4f65-8bfb-77074517baaa"

# Project tokens work for:
railway up           # Deploy
railway status       # Check status  
railway redeploy     # Redeploy
railway variables    # Environment variables

# Project tokens DON'T work for:
railway whoami       # Needs account token
railway logs         # May be restricted
railway list         # Needs account token
```

### **Current Service Status**
- **contextlite-testing**: Has abandoned cart system with SQL bug
- **contextlite**: Main production, no abandoned cart endpoints  
- **contextlite-backup**: Backup service, no abandoned cart endpoints

### **SSH Usage (Non-Interactive)**
```bash
# Execute single commands only
railway ssh -s contextlite-testing -- ls -la
railway ssh -s contextlite-testing -- cat /app/abandoned_carts.db
railway ssh -s contextlite-testing -- find /app -name "*.db"

# Some containers have no shell - use HTTP endpoints instead
curl -s "https://contextlite-testing-production.up.railway.app/cart/status"
```

### **Debugging Abandoned Carts**
```bash
# Working endpoints:
curl -s "https://contextlite-testing-production.up.railway.app/health"
curl -X POST "https://contextlite-testing-production.up.railway.app/cart/abandon"

# Broken endpoint (SQL bug):
curl -s "https://contextlite-testing-production.up.railway.app/cart/status"
# Error: "sql: Scan error converting NULL to int64"
```
