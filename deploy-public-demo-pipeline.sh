# Phase 1: Server Infrastructure
echo "🏗️  Phase 1: Server Infrastructure Setup"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

claude -p "Create a comprehensive DigitalOcean droplet deployment script for ContextLite public demo server. Include: 8GB RAM 4vCPU Ubuntu 22.04 setup, Docker installation, nginx with SSL, fail2ban security, automated backups, firewall rules for ports 80/443/22 only, and SSH key authentication. Output should be a complete bash script named 'provision-server.sh' that can provision and secure a production server in one command." | \

claude -p "Enhance the server provisioning script with advanced security hardening: disable root login, configure UFW firewall with strict rules, install and configure fail2ban with custom jail rules for web traffic, set up automatic security updates, configure log rotation, add intrusion detection, and create a dedicated 'contextlite' user with sudo privileges. Also add monitoring tools: htop, iotop, nethogs for resource monitoring." | \

claude -p "Add SSL certificate automation using Let's Encrypt/Certbot to the server script. Configure nginx virtual host for demo.contextlite.com with SSL, security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), rate limiting (10 req/min per IP), and reverse proxy to Docker container on port 8080. Include automatic certificate renewal and nginx optimization for performance."

# Phase 2: Data Pipeline  
echo "📊 Phase 2: Real Data Ingestion Pipeline"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

claude -p "Create a data ingestion pipeline script that clones and indexes real large-scale public repositories for ContextLite demo. Target repos: microsoft/vscode, facebook/react, golang/go, rust-lang/rust, nodejs/node, tensorflow/tensorflow, kubernetes/kubernetes. Script should: clone repos with --depth=1 for efficiency, run ContextLite indexing on each repo, optimize SQLite database, create statistics summary, and verify index integrity. Include progress tracking and error handling." | \

claude -p "Enhance the data pipeline with advanced optimization: implement parallel processing for multiple repo cloning, add database compression and indexing optimization, create incremental update capability for repo freshness, generate performance benchmarks and statistics, add data validation and integrity checks. Include cleanup of .git directories to save space and memory mapping optimization for large datasets." | \

claude -p "Add real-time data pipeline monitoring and metrics collection. Track: indexing speed (files/second), database size growth, memory usage during indexing, query performance benchmarks, and error rates. Create a dashboard data export in JSON format with statistics like total files indexed, languages detected, database size, and sample query performance times."

# Phase 3: Secure Web Terminal
echo "🖥️  Phase 3: Secure Web Terminal Interface"  
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

claude -p "Create a secure web terminal interface using xterm.js that connects to real ContextLite binary running in Docker containers. Include: WebSocket server for terminal communication, Docker container spawning with resource limits (512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU), session management with 15-minute timeouts, command filtering for security, and real-time output streaming. Use Node.js/Express backend with proper error handling and logging." | \

claude -p "Enhance the web terminal with advanced security and user experience features: implement command history and auto-completion, add syntax highlighting for ContextLite output, create session recording and replay capability, add copy/paste support, implement terminal resizing, and create a command reference sidebar. Include abuse prevention: rate limiting, command validation, and suspicious activity detection." | \

claude -p "Add production-ready features to the web terminal: implement load balancing for multiple concurrent users, add session persistence across browser refreshes, create user analytics tracking (commands used, session duration, popular searches), add responsive design for mobile access, implement graceful error handling and recovery, and create admin dashboard for monitoring active sessions and system health."

# Phase 4: Production Deployment
echo "🚀 Phase 4: Production Deployment Automation"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

claude -p "Create a complete production deployment script that orchestrates the entire ContextLite public demo setup. Script should: execute server provisioning, upload and build ContextLite binary, run data ingestion pipeline, deploy web terminal interface, configure nginx and SSL, start all services, run health checks, and create deployment verification. Include rollback capability and detailed logging of each step." | \

claude -p "Add comprehensive monitoring and maintenance automation: implement health check endpoints, create automated backup scripts for database and configuration, add log aggregation and rotation, implement performance monitoring with alerts, create auto-scaling for high traffic, and add maintenance mode capability. Include deployment status dashboard and notification system for administrators." | \

claude -p "Create final integration and testing suite: implement end-to-end testing of all demo functionality, create load testing for concurrent users, add security penetration testing checklist, implement automated deployment verification, create performance regression testing, and add user acceptance testing scenarios. Include documentation for troubleshooting common issues and performance tuning."

# Phase 5: Launch and Monitoring
echo "📈 Phase 5: Launch Preparation and Monitoring"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

claude -p "Create launch preparation checklist and monitoring dashboard for ContextLite public demo. Include: pre-launch testing checklist, performance benchmarking suite, user analytics setup with privacy compliance, SEO optimization for demo page, social media integration for sharing, feedback collection system, and conversion tracking from demo to download. Add launch announcement templates for different channels." | \

claude -p "Develop comprehensive post-launch monitoring and optimization strategy: implement real-time performance monitoring with alerting, create user behavior analytics and heatmaps, add A/B testing framework for demo improvements, implement feedback analysis and feature request tracking, create regular performance reports, and add competitive analysis tracking. Include growth hacking strategies for increasing demo usage."
