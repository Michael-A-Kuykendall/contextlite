- **Required**: Verify DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD secrets
- **Status**: ❌ NEEDS FIX - Repository not found

#### [❌] 2.4 Homebrew Deployment
- **Issue**: Formula not found in Homebrew
- **Investigation**: contextlite.rb not in homebrew-core repository
- **Required**: Submit formula to homebrew-core or create homebrew tap
- **Status**: ❌ NEEDS FIX - Formula missing from Homebrew

#### [ ] 2.5 Crates.io Deployment
- **Issue**: Package not found on crates.io
- **Investigation**: Check if Rust wrapper was uploaded
- **Required**: Verify CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret
- **Workflow**: Check crates deployment job

#### [ ] 2.6 Snap Store Deployment
- **Issue**: Package not found in Snap Store
- **Investigation**: Check snapcraft configuration and upload
- **Required**: Verify SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN secret
- **Dependency**: Requires working GoReleaser

#### [ ] 2.7 AUR Deployment
- **Issue**: Package not found in AUR

- **Investigation**: Check if manifest was submitted to winget-pkgs
- **Required**: Implement Winget deployment workflow
- **Status**: Not implemented yet

### **PHASE 3: Secrets and Configuration Audit**

#### [ ] 3.1 GitHub Repository Secrets Audit
- **Action**: Verify all required secrets exist and are valid
- **Required Secrets**:
  - [ ] GITHUB_TOKEN (automatic)
  - [ ] PYPI_API_TOKEN
  - [ ] NPM_TOKEN  
  - [ ] DOCKER_USERNAME
  - [ ] DOCKER_PASSWORD
  - [ ] CHOCOLATEY_API_KEY
  - [ ] CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN
  - [ ] SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN
  - [ ] AUR_KEY
  - [ ] HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN

#### [ ] 3.2 Workflow Permissions Audit
- **Action**: Ensure all workflows have correct permissions
- **Check**: contents: write, packages: write, id-token: write
- **Verify**: No permission-related failures in workflow logs

### **PHASE 4: Binary Build Pipeline**

#### [ ] 4.1 Core Binary Build Process
- **Issue**: build-binaries job may be failing
- **Action**: Test local build with `make build`
- **Verify**: Binaries are created and accessible for downstream jobs

#### [ ] 4.2 Cross-Platform Build Verification
- **Action**: Ensure Windows, macOS, Linux binaries all build correctly
- **Check**: GoReleaser builds for all target platforms
- **Verify**: Binary artifacts are uploaded to GitHub releases

### **PHASE 5: Workflow Orchestration**

- **Action**: Review needs: clauses in workflow jobs
- **Verify**: Jobs run in correct order

### **PHASE 6: End-to-End Testing**

#### [ ] 6.1 Package Manager Integration Tests
- **Action**: Run `./test/deployment/validate_package_managers.sh` after each fix
- **Target**: Achieve >80% success rate (8/10 packages working)
- **Document**: Update this checklist with each successful fix

#### [ ] 6.2 Full Deployment Pipeline Test
- **Action**: Test complete pipeline with test tag
- **Command**: `git tag v1.0.48-test && git push --tags`
- **Verify**: All package managers receive the test version
- **Cleanup**: Remove test tag after verification
