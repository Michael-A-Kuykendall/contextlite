## Audit Objective
Conduct a final, uncompromising production readiness shakedown of the ContextLite codebase and product. Ensure all critical areas are validated for commercial launch, with no gaps in security, reliability, business logic, or user experience.

---

## 1. Security & Licensing
- [x] Validate license system robustness (RSA, hardware binding, trial, activation limits)
  - **Finding:** License system uses RSA signatures, hardware binding, and enforces activation limits (Dev=1, Pro=3, Enterprise=10). 14-day trial logic present and tested. No bypass vectors found in code review or tests.
- [x] Attempt to identify bypass/spoofing vectors for license/trial
  - **Finding:** No bypass or spoofing vectors found. Trial and license checks are enforced at all feature gates. Hardware binding and signature verification are robust.
- [x] Check secure handling of keys/secrets (no secrets in repo)
  - **Finding:** No private keys or secrets found in repo. Only public key is embedded for license verification.
- [x] Review API endpoint security (auth, input validation, rate limiting)
  - **Finding:** API endpoints protected by bearer token authentication. Input validation present. No rate limiting, but endpoints are not public-facing.
- [x] Ensure private binary protection
