# Quick Fix Priority List - ContextLite Deployment
*Action Items for Production Launch Readiness*

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (Today)

### 1. **GitHub Release Version Mismatch** - 🔥 CRITICAL
**Problem**: v1.0.28 release contains v0.9.0 binary
**Command to verify**:
```bash
# Download and check what we're actually serving users
curl -L "https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/contextlite/releases/download/v1.0.28/contextlite-windows-amd64.zip" -o test.zip
unzip test.zip && ./contextlite.exe --version
# Should show v1.0.28 but shows v0.9.0
```

**Fix**: Update GitHub Actions to build with correct version tag
**ETA**: 2 hours

### 2. **Docker Repository Missing** - 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Problem**: `docker pull contextlite/contextlite` fails - repository doesn't exist
**Command to verify**:
```bash
docker pull contextlite/contextlite:latest
# Error: repository does not exist
```

**Fix**: Debug Docker publish workflow, check credentials
**ETA**: 4 hours
