# Show the difference
echo "📊 Memory Comparison:"
echo "--------------------"
echo "❌ Bad Approach (Our Original Design):"
echo "   - Background daemon every 45 seconds"
echo "   - Audit process every 3 minutes" 
echo "   - Continuous memory usage"
echo "   - Process scanning overhead"
echo "   - Potential memory leaks"
echo ""
echo "✅ Good Approach (Industry Standard):"
echo "   - Zero background processes"
echo "   - Cleanup only when allocating ports"
echo "   - Event-driven like Docker/Kubernetes"
echo "   - Zero memory overhead when idle"
echo "   - No continuous process scanning"

echo "🎯 INDUSTRY STANDARDS RESEARCH:"
echo "------------------------------"
echo "✅ Docker: Event-driven port management (no polling)"
echo "✅ Kubernetes: Event-driven service discovery"
echo "✅ systemd: Event-driven socket activation"
echo "✅ nginx: Optional health checks (10-30s when enabled)"
echo "✅ Database pools: 300-600 second timeouts (not 45s!)"

echo "🚀 RESULT:"
echo "🎯 Ports are invisible to users"
echo "💾 Zero memory overhead"
echo "⚡ Better performance (no continuous scanning)"
echo "🏭 Industry-standard architecture"

echo "🧙‍♂️ Perfect Wizard of Oz effect with zero memory concerns!"
