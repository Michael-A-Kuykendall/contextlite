## Final Notes

The key to success with commission-only reps is finding those who are ALREADY successful in this model. They have the discipline, network, and hunger to succeed without base salary. Focus recruitment efforts on finding these proven hunters rather than trying to convert traditional salespeople to the commission-only model.

Remember: One excellent commission-only rep can generate $50k-100k in monthly revenue. It's worth being selective to find the right ones.
