## üìã IMMEDIATE QUICK FIXES (30 minutes)

### Test Failures to Fix

- [x] **Fix empty files causing compilation errors**
  - [x] `validate_api_fixes.go` - currently empty, needs package declaration or deletion
  - [x] `examples/enterprise/main.go` - currently empty, needs package or deletion
  - [x] `verify_complete_api.go` - currently empty, deleted

- [x] **Fix API signature mismatches from refactoring**
  - [x] `internal/api/server_test.go:59` - `pipeline.New()` call needs ContextEngine parameter
  - [x] `internal/api/server_test.go:65` - `New()` call missing FeatureGate parameter
  - [x] `internal/api/server_test.go:708` - Remove reference to `pipeline` field (doesn't exist)
  - [x] `internal/api/server_test.go:1184` - Fix SaveWorkspaceWeights parameter types

- [x] **Fix enterprise module field references**
  - [x] `internal/enterprise/mcp.go:84,294,346` - `featureGate.ValidateCustomMCP` method missing
  - [x] `internal/enterprise/tenant.go:55` - `featureGate.ValidateMultiTenant` method missing

- [x] **Fix license module formatting issue**
  - [x] `internal/license/license.go:115` - String format mismatch for MaxUsers int

- [ ] **Clean up TODO comments (optional - 16 total)**
  - [ ] Review and remove sensitive TODO/FIXME comments per patent plan

### Expected Test Results After Fixes
- [x] Core engine tests: 4/4 passing ‚úÖ (already working)
- [x] Pipeline tests: 13/13 passing ‚úÖ (already working)
- [x] Storage tests: ~40/40 passing ‚úÖ (already working)
- [x] API server tests: Most passing (1 unrelated nil pointer issue)
- [x] Enterprise tests: Compiling successfully ‚úÖ
- [x] Integration tests: Will fail without running server (expected)

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS FROM PREFLIGHT ANALYSIS

1. **Perfect Timing**: Our architectural refactoring aligns perfectly with distribution requirements
2. **Zero Rework**: Clean binary architecture means no code changes needed for packaging
3. **Professional Foundation**: Naming conventions and interfaces ready for marketplace acceptance
4. **Scalable Design**: Private/public split supports both free and pro distribution channels

## üö® CRITICAL PATH DEPENDENCIES

1. **Test Fixes** ‚Üí **Package Creation** ‚Üí **Signing Setup** ‚Üí **CI/CD** ‚Üí **Launch**
2. **Business Accounts** can be set up in parallel with technical work
3. **Content Creation** (blogs, demos) can happen during package testing phase
4. **Marketing Materials** should be ready 2-3 days before technical launch
